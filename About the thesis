The Euler-Bernoulli beam equation is a fundamental equation in structural mechanics used to describe the deformation and bending of beams under load. 
It assumes certain simplifying assumptions, including that the beam is slender, the deformation is small, and the material behaves linearly. However, when 
beams are subjected to large deformations or are made of materials with non-linear properties, the assumptions of linear elasticity break down. 
A thesis on this topic may explore how to modify the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation to account for non-linear behavior, considering factors like material nonlinearity, 
large deformations, or geometric nonlinearity. Such a thesis could involve theoretical derivations, numerical simulations, and possibly experimental validation of
the non-linear beam equations. The goal would be to provide a more accurate representation of beam behavior under non-linear conditions, which is important in 
various engineering and structural analysis applications.
