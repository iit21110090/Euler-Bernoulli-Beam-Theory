Firstly, I derived the Linear Euler Bernoulli Beam Equation. In Linear beam theory, I derived the derivation of curvature, the relationship between moment and curvature.
Then I did the derivation of the Non-Linear beam equation of the Murthy Thesis. That is to make it easy to understand the mathematical concept of the equation.
